0.9.3
-----------------------

- fix issue6: quickly make detox work with tox-1.6 again (although not all 1.6 features
  supported, e.g. --develop does not work)

- fix issue3: don't claim a TROVE identifier of "python3" because detox
  itself depends on eventlet which does not work on py3 yet. (Nevertheless
  detox will create py3 environments through tox of course)
